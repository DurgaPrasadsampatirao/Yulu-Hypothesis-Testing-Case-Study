# Recommendations:
• *Seasonal Marketing*: Since there is a clear seasonal pattern in the count of rental bikes, Yulu can adjust its marketing strategies accordingly. Focus on promoting bike rentals during the spring and summer months when there is higher demand. Offer seasonal discounts or special packages to attract more customers during these periods.

• *Time-based Pricing*: Take advantage of the hourly fluctuation in bike rental counts throughout the day. Consider implementing time-based pricing where rental rates are lower during off-peak hours and higher during peak hours. This can encourage customers to rent bikes during less busy times, balancing out the demand and optimizing the resources.

• *Weather-based Promotions*: Recognize the impact of weather on bike rentals. Create weatherbased promotions that target customers during clear and cloudy weather, as these conditions show the highest rental counts. Yulu can offer weather-specific discounts to attract more customers during these favorable weather conditions.

• *User Segmentation*: Given that around 81% of users are registered, and the remaining 19% are casual, Yulu can tailor its marketing and communication strategies accordingly. Provide loyalty programs, exclusive offers, or personalized recommendations for registered users to encourage repeat business. For casual users, focus on providing a seamless rental experience and promoting the benefits of bike rentals for occasional use.

• *Optimize Inventory*: Analyze the demand patterns during different months and adjust the inventory accordingly. During months with lower rental counts such as January, February, and March, Yulu can optimize its inventory levels to avoid excess bikes. On the other hand, duringpeak months, ensure having sufficient bikes available to meet the higher demand.

• *Improve Weather Data Collection*: Given the lack of records for extreme weather conditions, consider improving the data collection process for such scenarios. Having more data on extreme weather conditions can help to understand customer behavior and adjust the operations accordingly, such as offering specialized bike models for different weather conditions or implementing safety measures during extreme weather.

• *Customer Comfort*: Since humidity levels are generally high and temperature is often below 28 degrees Celsius, consider providing amenities like umbrellas, rain jackets, or water bottles to enhance the comfort and convenience of the customers. These small touches can contribute to a positive customer experience and encourage repeat business.

• *Collaborations with Weather Services*: Consider collaborating with weather services to provide real-time weather updates and forecasts to potential customers. Incorporate weather information into your marketing campaigns or rental app to showcase the ideal biking conditions and attract users who prefer certain weather conditions.

• *Seasonal Bike Maintenance*: Allocate resources for seasonal bike maintenance. Before the peak seasons, conduct thorough maintenance checks on the bike fleet to ensure they are in top condition. Regularly inspect and service bikes throughout the year to prevent breakdowns and maximize customer satisfaction.

• *Customer Feedback and Reviews*: Encourage customers to provide feedback and reviews on their biking experience. Collecting feedback can help identify areas for improvement, understand customer preferences, and tailor the services to better meet customer expectations.

• *Social Media Marketing*: Leverage social media platforms to promote the electric bike rental services. Share captivating visuals of biking experiences in different weather conditions, highlight customer testimonials, and engage with potential customers through interactive posts and contests. Utilize targeted advertising campaigns to reach specific customer segments and drive more bookings.

• *Special Occasion Discounts*: Since Yulu focusses on providing a sustainable solution for vehicular pollution, it should give special discounts on the occassions like Zero Emissions Day (21st September), Earth day (22nd April), World Environment Day (5th June) etc in order to attract new users.
