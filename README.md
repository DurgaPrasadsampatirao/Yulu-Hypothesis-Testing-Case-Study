## Key Objectives
1. **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Analyze how often customers use Yulu bikes, including peak usage hours, locations, and frequency.
2. **Customer Behavior**: Explore customer demographics, trip duration, and subscription patterns to identify key factors driving usage.
3. **Fleet Management Optimization**: Investigate how to optimize the bike fleet distribution and maintenance schedules based on demand patterns.
4. **Demand Forecasting**: Use historical data to forecast demand for Yulu bikes in various locations and times of day.
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Analyze the relationship between operational factors (e.g., bike availability, charging) and user satisfaction.

## Insights and Findings

### 1. Data Overview
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes information about Yulu's bike-sharing operations, including trip data, customer demographics, bike availability, and geographic distribution.
- **Key Columns**:
  - `trip_id`: Unique identifier for each bike trip.
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `start_time`: Start time of the trip.
  - `end_time`: End time of the trip.
  - `duration`: Duration of the trip in minutes.
  - `pickup_location`: Location where the bike was picked up.
  - `dropoff_location`: Location where the bike was dropped off.
  - `bike_id`: Unique identifier for the bike used in the trip.
  - `charging_status`: Whether the bike was fully charged at the start of the trip.
  - `subscription_type`: Type of user subscription (e.g., casual user, premium user).

### 2. Usage Pattern Analysis
- **Peak Usage Times**: Peak usage was observed during the morning and evening commute hours (7-9 AM and 5-7 PM), with significant usage on weekdays.
- **Popular Locations**: Key locations for bike usage include business districts, transportation hubs, and residential areas.
- **Trip Duration**: The average trip duration is approximately 20-30 minutes, with casual users tending to use bikes for shorter trips.

### 3. Customer Behavior Insights
- **Demographics**: The majority of Yulu users are young adults (ages 18-35), with a high proportion of tech-savvy individuals who prefer eco-friendly transportation solutions.
- **Subscription Patterns**: Premium users tend to have longer trips and more frequent usage, while casual users mostly use the bikes for short-term, one-off trips.
- **Customer Retention**: Premium users show higher retention rates and more frequent usage compared to casual users.

### 4. Fleet Management Optimization
- **Bike Availability**: Bike availability is correlated with customer satisfaction. High demand during peak hours often leads to unavailability of bikes in popular locations.
- **Fleet Distribution**: Optimizing fleet distribution across locations based on historical demand data can help improve bike availability and reduce waiting times for users.
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Bikes with lower usage are more prone to maintenance issues, requiring better tracking and predictive maintenance scheduling.

### 5. Demand Forecasting
- **Time-Based Forecasting**: Demand for bikes is higher during peak hours and weekends, with specific geographic locations showing more concentrated demand.
- **Location-Based Forecasting**: Demand in business districts is significantly higher during working hours, while demand in residential areas peaks during early mornings and evenings.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset is collected from Yulu’s operational logs, including user trip data, bike usage statistics, and maintenance records.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values, duplicates, and outliers were handled through imputation techniques and filtering.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations between different variables, such as trip duration, location, and bike availability.
4. **Forecasting**: Built forecasting models to predict demand based on historical usage data, using time series analysis and machine learning algorithms.
5. **Optimization**: Used optimization algorithms to improve fleet management and maintenance scheduling based on predicted demand.
